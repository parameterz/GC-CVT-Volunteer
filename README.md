# GC-CVT-Volunteer
 A simple website to manage volunteers for the Grossmont College CVT echo program. 

 https://parameterz.github.io/GC-CVT-Volunteer/
 
 The site should:

 - describe the specific of the event
 - state how many volunteers are needed
 - collect volunteer names and contact info
 - show how many signups are available/taken
 - store data in a convenient location (Google Sheets) so that instructors can access the volunteer information
