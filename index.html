            The CVT Echo program students need models to scan for their upcoming performance exam. If you are interested in earning 4 hours of volunteer time while 
            you lay quietly in a dark(-ish) room, this is the opportunity for you! 
        </p>
        <p>
            An echocardiogram is a mostly painless non-invasive ultrasound 
            exam of the heart performed while the model is lying quietly on an exam table that is rarely described as "pillowy". 
            Models will need to wear suitable attire to allow for unencumbered access to the imaging windows on the top and side of the chest. 
            A hospital gown and drape will be provided to ensure a comfortable, courteous, and professional exam experience. 
            There will be some pressure on your chest as the ultrasound transducer is applied and held for the images; 
            this has the potential to be mildly/briefly uncomfortable for some models. 
            Most students that have volunteered to serve as models say they were comfortable and they enjoyed the experience of seeing their heart beating in real time.
